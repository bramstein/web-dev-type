# Web Dev Type

Experimental web developer tools to show how flexible CSS properties interoperate, help authors manage the complex code required in stylesheets, determine property values based on font metrics, and test different user interfaces for making multidimensional decisions.

> “Text is the smallest indivisible part of design. A design “atom” if you will. [Typography Inspector](https://www.bramstein.com/typography-inspector) will show you how body text reacts to changes in the viewport.” — [Bram Stein, interviewed at TypeThursday](https://medium.com/type-thursday/improve-your-web-typography-with-this-one-plug-in-6f493d963072)

> “Typesetting decisions for the web apply in many contexts [... and] font metrics data can help guide good typographic decisions.” — [Tim Brown, Universal Typography demo](http://universaltypography.com/demo/)
